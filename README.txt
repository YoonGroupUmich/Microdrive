Microdrive designs for micro-LED silicon probes.

The .stl files are optimized for Formlabs Form2 printer and Grey Resin. For other printers and/or resins, some modifications may be necessary.

This microdrive was modified based on Hiroyuki Miyawaki's design. The latest version of his microdrive is available at https://github.com/Mizuseki-Lab/microdrive.

The original idea of the drive is described in the following paper.
