Microdrive designs for micro-LED silicon probes.

The .stl files are optimized for Formlabs Form2 printer and Grey Resin. For other printers and/or resins, some modifications may be necessary.

3 versions are made available here based on the same design but different travel lengths:
Mice drive: shell base 8.4 x 4.2 mm (WxL); height: 11.9 mm; travel distance 2.6 mm
Rat 1/2”: shell base 8.4 x 4.2 mm (WxL); height: 16.5 mm; travel distance 4 mm
Rat 5/8”: shell base 8.4 x 4.2 mm (WxL); height: 18.2 mm; travel distance 8.9 mm

This microdrive was modified based on Hiroyuki Miyawaki's design. The latest version of his microdrive is available at https://github.com/Mizuseki-Lab/microdrive.

The original idea of the drive is described in the following paper.
