Microdrive designs for silicon probes.

The .stl files are optimized for Formlabs Form2 printer and Grey-v4/Clear-v4 Resin. For other printers and/or resins, some modifications may be necessary.

1 version is made available here:
v18: shell base 3.2 x 7.5 mm (WxL); height: 16 mm; travel distance 5.8 mm

This microdrive was modified based on Hiroyuki Miyawaki's design. The latest version of his microdrive is available at https://github.com/Mizuseki-Lab/microdrive.

The original idea of the drive is described in the following paper.
